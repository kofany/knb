Few infromations about istallation, configuration n using this.

To compile u only need to:
(
% cd knb/src
% ./configure 
(
    * to delete old files founded during compilation do:
    % make clean 
)
% ./configure
% make (and choose your destiny :)) 
    * dynamic (make dynamic) (prefered for most systems)
    * static  (make static)
    * debug   (make debug)

To make a package do:
(
    % cd knb/src
    % ./configure
    % make release 
)

To make a src package do:
(
    % cd knb/src
    % ./configure 
    % make src
)

To make clean do:
(
    % cd knb/src
    % ./configure 
    % make clean
)

n dont care about warnings in linking ;)

When compilation falied, u can allways use packages, which u can find on this page. If binary validator reports "This file is hacked", it's only a warning now and does not stop execution.

For configuration file, there is example under name 'conf' 

Therein are described all available options

To add 1st mask/user u should:

> msg nick !new 

or on a channel where he is:
> !new 

then bot will add mask, which u gave
(
	in mask u can use chars `*', `?', i `#'
	* = replace any sequence of chars
	? = replace exactly one char
	# = replace exactly one number
)

Commands:

command should begin with char: `.' , `!' or `@'

more info in !help

{When u find in this README some erros or miss chars contact with me (my english is basic)}
